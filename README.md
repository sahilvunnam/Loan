# Loan Approval Predictor

This project performs data analysis and classification modeling to predict loan approval status based on applicant financial and demographic information. Using Python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Scikit-Learn, we analyze various factors impacting loan approval, preprocess the dataset, and build machine learning models to classify loans as approved or rejected.

Features
 - Data Cleaning and Transformation: Combines asset columns into "Movable" and "Immovable" assets and maps categorical features to numerical values.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
 - Visualizes distributions and relationships between key features like loan term, annual income, assets, and credit score, using histograms, box plots, and scatter plots.

Correlation Analysis: Examines feature correlations and their impact on loan approval.

Machine Learning Models:
 - Decision Tree Classifier
 - Random Forest Classifier

Model Evaluation:
 - Confusion Matrix

Classification Report
- RÂ² Score
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Key Insights
 - Visualizations reveal that higher credit scores and larger assets generally increase the likelihood of loan approval.
 - A heatmap provides insight into feature correlations to enhance feature selection for improved model performance.

This project is ideal for understanding data-driven decision-making in the loan approval process and demonstrates practical skills in data analysis, machine learning, and model evaluation.
